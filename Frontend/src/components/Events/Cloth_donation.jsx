                The Cloth Donation Drive is a vital initiative aimed at addressing the critical need for clothing donations in our community. Organized by the AVANA Club, this event brings together volunteers, donors, and local organizations to raise awareness about the importance of clothing donation and to facilitate the donation process.

            <p className="mt-4 text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-justify">
                Our team works closely with local shelters and NGOs to ensure that the donated clothes are used effectively and reach those in need. We provide all necessary information and support to donors, making the process as smooth and comfortable as possible.

                Through this initiative, we aim to not only increase the number of clothing donations but also to educate the community about the impact of their contributions. Every piece counts, and together, we can make a difference.
