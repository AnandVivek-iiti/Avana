        Diwali, the festival of lights, is a time for joy, togetherness, and
        celebration. The AVANA Club embraces this spirit by organizing a special
        Diwali Celebration event that brings the community together to share in
        the festivities.

      <p className="mt-4 text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-justify">
        Our Diwali Celebration features a variety of activities, including
        traditional performances, art and craft stalls, and delicious food. We
        encourage local artists and performers to showcase their talents,
        creating a vibrant atmosphere filled with creativity and cultural
        expression.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-justify">
        In addition to the festivities, we also emphasize the importance of
        giving back to the community during this auspicious time. Through our
        event, we organize donation drives to support local charities and
        initiatives, ensuring that the spirit of Diwali extends beyond
        celebration to include compassion and generosity.

        Join us in celebrating Diwali with joy, unity, and a commitment to
        making a positive impact in our community.
