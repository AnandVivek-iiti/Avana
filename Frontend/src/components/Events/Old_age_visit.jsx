                The Old Age Home Visit is a heartwarming initiative organized by the AVANA Club, aimed at bringing joy and companionship to the elderly residents of local old age homes. Our volunteers dedicate their time to interact with the seniors, listen to their stories, and engage them in various activities.

            <p className="mt-4 text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-justify">
                During these visits, we organize fun games, art and craft sessions, and even small performances to entertain the residents. Our goal is to create a lively and cheerful atmosphere, reminding them that they are not forgotten and that their contributions to society are valued.

            <p className="mt-4 text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-justify">
                We also take this opportunity to learn from the wisdom and experiences of the elderly, fostering intergenerational connections that benefit both the volunteers and the residents.
